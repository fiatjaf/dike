# DIKE: Desktop Immortan for Hosted Channels

This is an amazing piece of software, still work-in-progress, based on [IMMORTAN](https://github.com/fiatjaf/immortan), that can do Lightning things, it is a "lite node", as we may call.

And, most importantly, it is entirely GUI based.

For a thing that you can control programmatically try [clich√©](https://github.com/fiatjaf/cliche).

## Development

For development you can just do `sbt run`, and to compile a fat jar that later can be run with just `java -jar` do `sbt assembly`.
